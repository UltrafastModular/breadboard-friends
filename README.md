NOTE: This is a forked version of breadboard-friends and adds two addition BBFs, one using Thonkiconn 3.5mm Jacks (bbf-thonkjacks) and another providing eurorack header with polarity protection for providing eurorack power to your breadboard from euro bus (bbf-europower).
NOTE: This version converts the project from Eagle to KiCad and footprint updates to jacks, including oval holes
